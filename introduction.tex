\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

This thesis is a theoretical study on how to control quantum dynamics of quasiparticles in a periodic lattice potential. 
Although some work presented in the thesis is quite general and can be applied to any system with a periodic potential, 
the main subjects of the research are systems of ultracold atoms and molecules as their experimental manipulation is 
relatively easy. The control schemes proposed in the thesis also relate closely with the recent developments of laser 
cooling and trapping of atoms and molecules. Therefore, to give readers a broad context in which to understand the 
thesis, this chapter presents an introductory overview of the field of ultracold atoms and molecules. In \autoref{sec:ultracold}, we 

 Since the thesis is on the control of quantum 
dynamics, we will focus on the controllability property of ultracold systems. 

Finally, we give an outline of the thesis in \autoref{sec:outline} and discuss the connection of work in this thesis to the
field of ultracold atoms and molecules.
