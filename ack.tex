\chapter{Acknowledgments}


First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Roman Krems for accepting me into his group and giving me helpful guidance throughout my PhD study.
Also I want to thank Prof. Yan Alexander Wang, Prof. Mark Thachuk
and Prof. Gren Patey for their help during my time in Vancouver.
 
I truly appreciate fruitful discussions and collaborations with Marina Litinskaya, Evgeny Shapiro and Felipe Herrera. In addition, I want to thank Yu Zhang, Yakun Chen and Zhiying Li for their useful advice on life and career.
 
 
Especially, I am grateful to my wife for her love, support and encouragement. She brings a lot of happiness to my life and I am very
lucky to have such a lovely and smart life partner.
And last but not least, I thank my father for inspiring my
interest in science since my childhood, and my mother for being supportive all these years. I owe too much to my parents
for their everlasting love and support.
